In this game, two player can play.

Each player roll the dice. The first to reach 100 points is the winner.

The game includes 2 players on a single screen.
Each player has a temporary score (ROUND) and an overall score (GLOBAL).

At each turn, the player has his ROUND initialized to 0 and can roll a dice as many times as he wishes. The
result of a throw is added to the ROUND score.
During his turn, the player can decide at any time to:

-   Click on the “Hold” option, which sends the points of the ROUND score to the GLOBAL score. It will then be the
    other player's turn.
-   Roll the dice. If he rolls a 1, his ROUND score is lost and his turn ends.

The first player to reach 100 points on global wins the game.

Enjoy!!!
